# OTCamera

OTCamera is a core module of the [OpenTrafficCam framework](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam) to record videos over multiple days with a custom camera system based on Raspberry Pi Zero W.
In the recorded videos, one can detect and track objects (road users) using [OTVision](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTVision) or other tools and on the resulting trajectories, one can perform traffic analysis using [OTAnalytics](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTAnalytics).

Check out the [documentation](https://opentrafficcam.org/OTCamera) for detailed instructions on how to assemble and use OTCamera.

We appreciate your support in the form of both code and comments. First, please have a look at the [contribute](https://opentrafficcam.org/contribute) section of the OpenTrafficCam documentation.
